GetView is not handled correctly in almost every implementation of ILife

based on lookup4x4

1/
keep a list (index in _current) of alive cell or potential-birth cell (neighbours of alive cells)
in Set, add cell and neighbour cell in alive list (if not already added)
 TL   T   TR         if TL <> 0, add x-1,y-1 | x,y-1 | x-1,y to alive list
  L       R          if T <> 0, add x,y-1 to alive list
 BL   B   BR         ...
in NextGeneration, same as Set

2/
instead of an array of cell, we could store a list of super cell containing 4x4 or 8x8 cell + coordinates + pointers to neighbours super cell

3/
64 bits could store a 8x4 instead of 4x4, 8x4 + neighbours gives 10x6 which fits in a 64 bits
